The study found that the temperature increase in China from February to April and the correlation between temperature increase and the prevalence of Ae. albopictus indicate that warming temperatures may significantly impact the distribution and risk of the mosquito, which is the sole vector for dengue outbreaks in China. The authors acknowledge several limitations, including the possible bias in predicted climate data due to the lack of meteorological records and mosquito surveillance data in some areas, the uncertainty of future climate trends and population growth in China, and the unknown vector status and impact of climate change on other Aedes and non-Aedes mosquito species.
