The authors suggest a comprehensive management approach that includes dietary interventions, physical exercise, weight loss, and medication therapy.\n\nThe authors do acknowledge some limitations in their review. They mention that the literature on the relationship between HFDs and PCOS is still evolving, and that the underlying mechanisms and impacts require more investigation. They also note that there is a lack of consensus on the types and proportions of fats that have the most deleterious effects on PCOS, and call for more research in this area to develop evidence-based and practical dietary intervention strategies. Additionally, the review primarily focuses on the metabolic and reproductive outcomes of PCOS, and the authors suggest that further research is needed to understand the effects of HFDs on other aspects of PCOS, such as psychosocial and mental health issues.\n\nOverall, the authors acknowledge that there are still many unanswered questions about the relationship between HFDs and PCOS, and that more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms and impacts on PCOS patients. They call for a comprehensive management approach that includes multidisciplinary interventions, and suggest that enhancing public health awareness and promoting healthy dietary habits are essential for the prevention and management of PCOS.",
