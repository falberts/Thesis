        "summ": "The study finds that the distribution of infected Dermacentor variabilis ticks is a subset of the overall vector range, with minimal changes in predictions despite the addition of nine years of surveillance data, highlighting the importance of targeted surveillance for understanding tick-borne pathogen exposure risk.\n\nThe authors explicitly acknowledge several limitations in the paper. Firstly, they note the limited availability of county-level surveillance data for D. variabilis throughout the predicted suitability range in the contiguous United States, indicating a general need for increased surveillance activities. Secondly, they highlight the challenge of passive surveillance for pathogens with low detection rates, suggesting that solely relying on new data collection for spatial risk assessments may not yield significant gains in information. Finally, they suggest the necessity of validating data in high-risk areas through active surveillance, particularly in regions where passive surveillance is lacking, emphasizing the importance of targeted surveillance for refining geographic risk estimates of tick-borne pathogens.",

        "summ": "The most important finding in this study is that adding more surveillance data to a species distribution model (SDM) resulted in negligible changes to the predicted distribution of Dermacentor variabilis ticks infected with Rickettsia montanensis bacteria.\n\nYes, the authors explicitly acknowledge limitations of the paper. The limitations mentioned include:\n\n1. The predicted distribution may not be accurate for the western US because the western population of D. variabilis may be a different species with different habitat requirements.\n2. The study only included data from ticks where infection status was known. Future modeling efforts could be improved by including data from additional locations where ticks were not tested for infection.\n3. Widespread county-level surveillance for D. variabilis in the United States is currently limited. This means that the SDMs may not be very accurate in areas where there is not a lot of data on tick distribution.\n4. Passively collected surveillance data may not be very effective for detecting pathogens with low prevalence. Targeted active surveillance efforts may be needed to improve the accuracy of the SDMs.",
