The authors used machine learning models to distinguish between the two conditions, with RF performing better than ET in terms of accuracy.\n\nThe authors acknowledge some limitations of their study. They mention that their dataset was relatively small and lacked additional data, such as radiological images, which could potentially introduce bias into the results. They plan to overcome this limitation by augmenting their dataset with a larger patient pool and incorporating multi-center studies in the future to enhance the model's accuracy. Additionally, they note that there was less research on CD8+ T cells in children with asthma compared to CD4+ T cells and that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells have distinct roles in recognizing antigens presented by different MHC molecules. However, they suggest that CD8+ T cells, particularly those producing high levels of IFN-gamma, could be involved in attenuating pulmonary allergic inflammation. Overall, the authors recognize the importance of expanding the dataset and integrating multiple diagnostic tools to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the complex immunological patterns associated with asthmatic bronchitis and asthma.",
