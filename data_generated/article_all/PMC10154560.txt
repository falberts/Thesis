The most important finding in this study is that in a series of patients with Dunbar syndrome undergoing MAL release and stenting, two patients had major complications related to stenting (occlusion and displacement) requiring reintervention. No clear evidence is present in the literature regarding the necessity and timing of endovascular revascularization in all cases. Limitations include the retrospective design, small sample size, and lack of consideration of potential confounding factors, such as age and CT expiratory velocity, which impact the clinical outcome. The authors suggest a systematic combined approach of a laparoscopic release of the MAL with stenting during the same procedure for symptomatic patients presenting with Dunbar syndrome. However, they propose that every patient with an incidental finding of an MAL should undergo further investigations.
