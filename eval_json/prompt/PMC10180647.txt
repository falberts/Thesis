[START TEXT]Given the prevalence of HFDs and the increasing incidence of obesity among women of reproductive age, it is crucial to understand the effects of HFDs on the development and progression of PCOS. This review highlights the need to unravel the complex mechanisms of PCOS pathology and the interactions among the related contributing factors in order to recognize the deleterious impact of HFDs on PCOS. Furthermore, it demonstrates how HFDs can exacerbate all metabolic and reproductive outcomes of PCOS patients. HFDs can cause insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia, leading to increased fat synthesis and decreased fat breakdown. Additionally, HFDs increase the production of inflammatory lipid factors, further exacerbating fat synthesis. According to the aforementioned, there is a potential correlation between HFDs and PCOS; however, the exact mechanisms and impacts require further investigation. In the future, it is imperative to continue in-depth explorations of the association between HFDs and PCOS, and incorporate these into a comprehensive management approach for PCOS, encompassing multidisciplinary interventions such as dietary interventions, physical exercise, weight loss, and medication therapy, to achieve optimal clinical outcomes. Additionally, enhancing public health awareness and promoting healthy dietary habits can aid in the prevention of PCOS occurrence and progression. Future research should also focus on the effects of different types and proportions of fats on PCOS to develop evidence-based and practical dietary intervention strategies for more effective prevention and management of PCOS. In conclusion, further rigorous research and application of the relationship between HFDs and PCOS in clinical practice are warranted to facilitate the health management and prevention of PCOS among affected individuals.

For factual consistency, a score of 1 is assigned when all information is in line with the original text. A score of 2 is assigned, for example when the information is correct but contains little to no detail. A score of 3 is assigned when the summary contains information that is not in line with the original text.
        
For coverage, a score of 1 is assigned when the summary covers all limitations mentioned in the original text. A score of 2 is assigned when all limitations are mentioned, but not explained. A score of 3 is assigned when the summary fails to mention all limitations.
        
For coherence, a score of 1 is assigned when the summary is coherent and does not contain hallucinations. A score of 2 is assigned when the summary does not follow the instructions in the prompt perfectly, but is still coherent and does not include hallucinations. A score of 3 is assigned when the summary contains hallucinations or is incomprehensible, for example when abbreviations are used but never explained.
