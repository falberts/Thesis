The most important finding in this study is that the inclusion of additional surveillance and testing data slightly altered predictions of the distribution of D. variabilis and D. variabilis infected with R. montanensis, but the general patterns of suitability and variable importance remained similar. The authors did not explicitly mention any limitations in the provided text. However, they acknowledged the need for further research to address potential limitations such as the use of passive surveillance data for some pathogens and the need for active surveillance in undersampled areas to validate risk assessments. They also suggested that validation efforts would benefit from refining geographic risk estimates through targeted surveillance and resolving distributional boundaries.
