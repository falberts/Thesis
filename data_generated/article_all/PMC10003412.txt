The most important finding in this study is that various recombinant VLPs derived from the major capsid protein VP1 of nine Human Polyomaviruses (HPyVs) showed high immunogenicity, and these VLPs induced both humoral and cellular immune responses.

Regarding the limitations, the authors acknowledge that only one or a few VLPs derived from different HPyVs have been investigated within the same experimental setting in previous studies. They did not explicitly discuss other potential limitations. However, it can be inferred from the text that the complexity of the chemical composition of essential oils, the impact of VLP size on humoral immune response, and the structural antigenic comparison of VLPs are factors that may have limitations in the generalizability of the findings.
