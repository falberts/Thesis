Despite a slightly longer operative time and higher rate of major complications in the group with MAL compression caused by a bleeding gastrointestinal source (BG), the operative time and postoperative complications were lower in the group without MAL compression (DG). Limitations of the study include its retrospective design, which may introduce selection bias, and the small sample size which limits the statistical power. Additionally, the paper does not specify whether all patients in the BG group had pre-existing MAL compression or if it was a complication from the gastrointestinal bleeding. The document also notes the lack of consensus in the literature regarding the use of endovascular revascularization for MAL compression, and suggests further research is needed to determine the optimal timing and patient population for this intervention.",

No clear evidence exists on the need for endovascular revascularization after MAL release, and the timing remains uncertain. The authors acknowledge some limitations, including the retrospective design, the small sample size, and the lack of a standardized approach for post-operative management of TC or SMA stenosis after MAL release. The authors also note that only a few studies have reported series of more than 10 cases for comparison, and more research is needed to establish the optimal management strategy. They recommend systematic investigations for every patient found to have an MAL, and consideration of a laparoscopic release and stenting for symptomatic Dunbar syndrome patients.

Limitations include the retrospective design, small sample size, and lack of consideration of potential confounding factors, such as age and CT expiratory velocity, which impact the clinical outcome.
