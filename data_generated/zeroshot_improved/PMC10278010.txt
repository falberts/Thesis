The most important finding of this study is that infected ticks have a distribution that is a subset of the full vector range, as shown in both original and updated datasets. However, the authors acknowledge that SDM estimates of tick distributions can have limitations and that validation through active surveillance is essential, particularly in areas identified as high risk but with limited passive surveillance data. They also suggest that targeted surveillance efforts can help resolve distributional boundaries and improve risk assessments. The authors mention that the updated dataset included in this study had some limitations, such as missing data points and potential bias due to uneven distribution of surveillance sites. However, they also note that these limitations were minimized by the large size of the dataset and the use of multiple models and validation metrics. They caution that future studies should consider the potential for undersampling or bias in surveillance datasets and the importance of incorporating pathogen testing results into distribution modeling to better estimate transmission risk. Additionally, they suggest that improving data sharing and collaboration between research groups could help address limitations in data availability and quality. Overall, the authors acknowledge several limitations in their study but also emphasize the importance of using SDM to inform tick surveillance and monitoring strategies and the need for continued data collection and validation efforts.
