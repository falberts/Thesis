The largest meta-analysis and meta-regression on postpartum depression prevalence found that the unadjusted global prevalence rate is 19.18%, which increases to 19.9% for possible cases and 18.28% for probable cases after adjusting for EPDS cutoffs. The strongest predictor of PPD was SSB consumption. The study did not find a significant association between seafood consumption and PPD prevalence, contrasting previous research. Limitations included the use of self-report PPD measures and inaccuracies in nutrition data. The ecological fallacy should be considered when interpreting aggregate data.
