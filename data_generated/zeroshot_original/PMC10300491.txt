The study found that firefighters have an elevated risk of mesothelioma, bladder, testis, prostate, and colon cancer, as well as NHL and melanoma, compared to the general population. Limitations of the study include the influence of bias, such as medical surveillance bias, healthy worker bias, and confounding, especially with regards to asbestos exposure and smoking status. Studies have shown thatFirefighters are exposed to various carcinogenic hazards during fire and non-fire events, including asbestos, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and diesel engine exhaust, but the exact mixtures and compositions of exposures in the occupation have changed significantly over time and differ by region and type of fire suppression activity. The lack of consistent and detailed exposure assessment across studies makes it difficult to estimate the risk of specific cancer types and to tease out the contribution of individual carcinogens. Furthermore, the available cancer incidence studies with ICD-10 codes capable of capturing mesothelioma diagnoses may not fully account for the risk of this cancer in older cohort studies, as a cause-of-death code for mesothelioma was not available before 1999. Overall, while the epidemiological evidence suggests positive associations between occupational exposure as a firefighter and cancer incidence for several sites, the authors acknowledge that the complex and changing nature of firefighter exposures and potential confounding factors make causal assessments challenging.
