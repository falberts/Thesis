The study demonstrates that nine different human, mammalian, and avian Polyomavirus (PyV) VLPs derived from their major capsid protein VP1 are immunogenic, inducing humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, and shows significant antigenic similarity, as evidenced by cross-reactivity between the VP1 specific antibodies. The authors suggest that more investigations are needed to understand the role and mechanisms of immune protection against severe diseases caused by different PyVs.

The authors acknowledge several limitations of their study. Firstly, they note that they only demonstrated the immunogenicity of nine out of the ten known HPyVs, and the immunogenicity of HPyV10 was not investigated. Additionally, they acknowledge that the uptake and presentation of VLPs by APCs and the subsequent immune response may vary depending on the route of administration, the dose, and the animal species. Furthermore, they mention that their antigenic comparison was based on the primary structure of VP1 proteins, but future studies are needed to assess the structural and functional aspects of antigenic similarity. Lastly, the authors suggest that further investigations are necessary to understand the mechanisms of immune protection against severe diseases caused by different PyVs.

Overall, the authors provide an awareness of the limitations of their study, acknowledging the need for further research to deepen the understanding of PyV biology and the immune responses to these viruses.
