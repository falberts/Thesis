The largest meta-analysis and meta-regression on postpartum depression (PPD) prevalence found that the unadjusted global prevalence rate using the EPDS scale is 19.18%, with possible PPD at 19.9% and probable PPD at 18.28%. The strongest predictor of PPD prevalence was SSB consumption, both between and within countries. However, the study did not find a significant association between seafood consumption and PPD prevalence, contradicting a previous report. Limitations include the use of self-report measures instead of clinical interviews, the difficulty in accurately collecting nutrition data, and the ecological fallacy of using aggregate data. The authors acknowledge the need for further research to understand the role of additional cultural factors and micronutrients in PPD prevalence. They also suggest that policies aimed at reducing SSB consumption may help prevent PPD. No explicit mention of limitations related to the sample size or the specific countries included in the study.
