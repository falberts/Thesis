The study found that common vitreomacular interface (VMI) abnormalities, including epiretinal membrane (ERM), posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), and vitreomacular adhesion (VMA), have significant heritability, with individual environmental effects explaining the remaining variance. The heritability and higher concordance of ERM, PVD, and VMA in monozygotic (MZ) than dizygotic (DZ) twins suggest a role for genetic factors. However, the authors acknowledge that their study was underpowered to calculate concordances and heritability for other VMI abnormalities and that there is a lack of consensus on the grading of ERM from spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). They also mention that there is a need for larger genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify genes implicated in the development of ERM. Additionally, some limitations include the study's reliance on self-reported data for secondary causes of VMI abnormalities and the possibility of survivor bias in the study's finding of a protective effect of smoking for ERM development. The authors call for the need for more research in this area to better understand the mechanisms behind VMI abnormalities and to develop potential treatments. No limits are provided by the authors for the heritability and concordance of ERM, PVD, and VMA, as those values were explicitly stated in the text.
