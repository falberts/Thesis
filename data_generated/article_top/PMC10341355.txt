The most important finding of this study is that common vitreomacular interface (VMI) abnormalities, including epiretinal membrane (ERM), posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), and vitreomacular adhesion (VMA), have heritability with individual environmental factors explaining the remaining variance. The study also found a higher prevalence of VMI abnormalities in older individuals and those with high myopia.

Limitations of the study include the fact that it was underpowered to estimate the heritability and concordance of vitreomacular hole (VMH), lattice macular hole (LMH), and macular hole (MH). The study also did not measure visual acuity, which could be important in assessing the impact of VMI abnormalities on vision. The cohort was also predominantly White Caucasian women, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. The study also used different methods to diagnose VMI abnormalities, which could affect the prevalence estimates. Finally, the study found a higher prevalence of PVD in female subjects, which could be due to a faster rate of PVD progression in women or a higher average age of DZ twins. However, the study did not investigate this further.
