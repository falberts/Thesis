The most important finding in this study is that the authors updated previously published RF models of D. variabilis and D. variabilis infected with R. montanensis using additional surveillance and testing data, revealing slight changes in suitability predictions with no major impact on predicted geographic distribution. They emphasized the importance of considering environmental factors, disease transmission dynamics, and data quality when interpreting SDM outputs. The authors also highlighted the limitations of current tick distribution maps as proxies for transmission risk maps and suggested incorporating pathogen testing results into distribution modeling to help constrain areas of transmission risk exposure.

No limitations are explicitly provided by the authors. However, it's worth noting that the study had some limitations, such as the reliance on passive surveillance data which may not capture the full picture of tick distribution and transmission risk, and the focus on RF models as the sole method for SDM. Additional limitations may include the potential for model overfitting or undersampling, the impact of environmental variability and temporal dynamics on tick distribution and transmission risk, and the potential for spatial and temporal autocorrelation in tick occurrence data. It would be important for future studies to address these limitations and consider a combination of methods for SDM, such as machine learning algorithms and statistical models, to improve model accuracy and reliability.
