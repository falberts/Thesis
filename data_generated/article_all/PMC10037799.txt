The most important finding in this study is that observed climate trends in China can be used to predict the future distribution of dengue risks, revealing a substantial increase in Ae. albopictus risk and expansion of the risk season by 2050. The authors acknowledge several limitations, including the lack of Ae. albopictus surveillance data in certain areas, the potential bias from using ground observations from other stations, and the uncertainty in future population trends and climate change. They suggest enhancing mosquito surveillance, calibrating the model based on future data, and addressing the uncertainty by adjusting the projected distribution of Ae. albopictus. No other limitations were explicitly mentioned in the text.
