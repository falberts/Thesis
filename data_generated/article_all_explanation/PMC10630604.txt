The most important finding in this study is that seventeen out of seventeen participants showed improved working memory performance with white noise (WN), while there was no statistical difference between the WN and no white noise conditions on the signal-to-noise ratio (CI). The authors suggest that this phenomenon might be explained by Stochastic Resonance (SR), but concede that more research is needed to fully understand the role of WN in working memory enhancement. The authors mention several limitations, including the lack of a control group, potential bias due to personal motivation, and the need for further research to understand the underpinnings of the SR effect on working memory.
