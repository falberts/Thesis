The study predicts an expansion of Ae. albopictus distribution and dengue risk season in China based on observed climate warming trends, with potential risks in previously unaffected northern areas and in border regions with other countries, despite some limitations, such as the lack of surveillance data and the uncertainty of future climate change and population trends.

The authors acknowledge several limitations in their study. One limitation is the lack of sufficient surveillance data and sparse meteorological records, particularly in western and northeastern China, leading to potential biases in the climate suitability predictions for Ae. albopictus in those areas. Another limitation is the absence of information on the vector status and impact of climate change on the distribution and activity of other Aedes mosquito species and non-Aedes vectors in China. Another limitation is the uncertainty of future global climate change, which may affect the accuracy of the projected Ae. albopictus distribution and risk estimates. Additionally, since future population growth in China is uncertain, there is uncertainty regarding future at-risk populations. The authors suggest updating the model with future data and adjusting the projections accordingly to address some of these uncertainties. Overall, the authors note that their study provides a foundation for monitoring and mitigating the potential risks of dengue transmission as climate warming continues.
