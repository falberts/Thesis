The most important finding of this study is that the fraction of individuals adopting social distancing requirements fluctuated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic dynamics, producing non-linear features in incidence trajectories that could not be reproduced by static alternatives.

The authors acknowledge several limitations of their study. Firstly, they used simulation population data generated from the latest available Australian Census data from 2016, which may not be precisely representative of the population during the pandemic period. They addressed this limitation by scaling the curves to reflect the current Australian population size. Secondly, their agent-based model did not simulate transmissions within healthcare facilities, but note that vaccine rollouts and mask mandates in healthcare facilities during the studied period reduced the impact of this limitation. Thirdly, they did not model the decline in vaccine efficacy explicitly, assuming it was balanced by third vaccination doses administered during the studied period. They acknowledge that this is a simplification, as the decline in vaccine efficacy is known to be monotonic, while the focus of their study was on modelling multiple peaks of distinct waves within a single pandemic stage.
