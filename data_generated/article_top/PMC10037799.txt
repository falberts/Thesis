The most important finding in this study is that using observed climate trends to predict future dengue risks worldwide, particularly in China, indicates the significant impact of warming temperatures on the northward expansion of Ae. albopictus distribution and the potential increase in the number of people at risk. The authors acknowledge several limitations, including the lack of Ae. albopictus surveillance data and sparse meteorological records in certain areas, the need for enhanced mosquito surveillance, the potential bias in predicted climate data due to the sparse observations, and the uncertainty in future climate change and population growth trends.
