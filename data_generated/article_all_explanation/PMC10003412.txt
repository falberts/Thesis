The most important finding of the study is that recombinant VLPs derived from the major capsid protein VP1 of nine Human Papatopic Viruses (HPyVs) have high immunogenicity and can induce strong humoral and cellular immune responses, with larger VLPs inducing a higher response due to the exposure of different VLP epitopes. The authors did not explicitly acknowledge any limitations in the text. However, they mentioned that previous studies have investigated only one or a few VP1 VLPs derived from different HPyVs, and that the differences in the humoral immune response could be related to different amino acid sequences on the surface of VLPs. They also suggested that more investigations are needed on the interaction of PyVs with the host immune system and on PyV-driven molecular mechanisms to evade the immune responses.
