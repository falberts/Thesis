The most important finding in this study is that seventeen out of seventeen participants showed improved performance in a working memory task with added white noise, possibly due to stochastic resonance or the suppression of tinnitus awareness, although the mechanisms remain unclear. The authors acknowledge limitations such as the lack of a control group, the variability in sample characteristics, and the small sample size, but no other limitations were explicitly stated.
