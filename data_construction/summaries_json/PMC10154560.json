They highlight the retrospective design and small sample size, which constrain the statistical analyses. They note the rarity of the condition, with few authors presenting series of more than 10 cases, which limits the generalizability of their findings. Additionally, the study's focus on a single center and the lack of a control group for comparison may impact the broader applicability of their results. They also emphasize the need for systematic investigations in patients with incidental MAL findings, suggesting a potential bias towards more symptomatic cases in their cohort. However, the authors do not address potential biases inherent in retrospective studies or the possibility of confounding variables influencing their results",
