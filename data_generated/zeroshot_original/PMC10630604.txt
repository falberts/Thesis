The study found that 68% of participants performed better in a Working Memory task with white noise (WN) compared to no noise, while 24% showed no difference, and 8% performed worst with noise. The authors suggest that Stochastic Resonance (SR) may explain this phenomenon by reducing neural activity and freeing up cognitive resources for higher WM task performance. However, the effects of WN on WM remain unclear, and more studies are needed to understand the constructive role of noise. The study also revealed a high prevalence of mild cognitive impairment and low WM capacity, as well as anxiety and depression symptoms in chronic tinnitus patients. However, the small sample size and lack of a control group limit the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the relationship between higher tinnitus handicap scores and worse WM performance was not statistically significant, and more research is needed to understand the effect of WN on high WM tests among participants with chronic tinnitus and normal hearing.

No explicit limitations are provided by the authors. However, possible limitations could be the small sample size and the lack of a control group that could have helped better understand the influence of white noise and avoid any bias. Additionally, the influence of personal motivation during test performance was not taken into account. Further research is needed to support the findings, especially in the areas of WM and Stochastic Resonance.
