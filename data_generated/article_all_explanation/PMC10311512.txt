The largest meta-analysis on postpartum depression (PPD) prevalence to date found that unadjusted global prevalence using the EPDS scale is 19.18% (95% CI: 18.02 to 20.34%). After adjusting for recommended EPDS cutoffs, the prevalence of possible PPD was 19.9% and probable PPD was 18.28%. The study also found a significant relationship between SSB consumption and PPD prevalence.

No explicit limitations are mentioned in the document. However, the authors note that cross-national variations in PPD prevalence may be influenced by methodological variables, such as the timing of assessment and EPDS cutoff used. They also acknowledge that their study focused on self-report PPD measures rather than clinical interviews, which may result in higher estimates, but they felt it was safer to overestimate PPD rather than underestimate it. The authors also mention the challenges in collecting accurate nutrition data and the importance of remembering the ecological fallacy when interpreting aggregate data.
