The authors note several limitations, including the challenges of directly comparing tick occurrence data from different sources due to potential differences in sampling effort and methods, the possibility that climate variables may not capture all aspects of the niche for these vectors, and the importance of considering other factors, such as host availability and demography, to accurately model tick distributions and infection risks. Additionally, they acknowledge that their analysis focused on specific tick-borne pathogens but that understanding the relationship between tick distributions, the distribution of other tick-borne pathogens, and climate could provide valuable insights into disease risk dynamics. They also emphasize the need for continued monitoring and validation of tick distribution models through targeted surveillance and field studies. No limitations are provided by the authors regarding the methods or assumptions of their modeling approach.",

        "summ": "The most important finding of this study is that infected ticks have a distribution that is a subset of the full vector range, as shown in both original and updated datasets. However, the authors acknowledge that SDM estimates of tick distributions can have limitations and that validation through active surveillance is essential, particularly in areas identified as high risk but with limited passive surveillance data. They also suggest that targeted surveillance efforts can help resolve distributional boundaries and improve risk assessments. The authors mention that the updated dataset included in this study had some limitations, such as missing data points and potential bias due to uneven distribution of surveillance sites. However, they also note that these limitations were minimized by the large size of the dataset and the use of multiple models and validation metrics. They caution that future studies should consider the potential for undersampling or bias in surveillance datasets and the importance of incorporating pathogen testing results into distribution modeling to better estimate transmission risk. Additionally, they suggest that improving data sharing and collaboration between research groups could help address limitations in data availability and quality. Overall, the authors acknowledge several limitations in their study but also emphasize the importance of using SDM to inform tick surveillance and monitoring strategies and the need for continued data collection and validation efforts.",

        "summ": "The most important finding of the study is that the inclusion of novel surveillance data in a previous RF model resulted in negligible differences in distribution estimates for Dermacentor variantabilis and its infection by Rickettsia montanensis, but highlighted the need for increased surveillance and targeted pathogen testing in areas of disagreement.\n\nThe authors acknowledge several limitations in the study. They note that while the updated models showed similar patterns of variable importance, there may be a need to consider the roles of different components of climate on shaping the niches for these vectors. They also mention that the predicted suitability distribution of the infected niche is geographically constrained compared to the full predicted suitability distribution, with most disagreement along the southern and western peripheries. The authors suggest that the limitations of using vector distribution maps as proxies for transmission risk maps directly can be addressed by incorporating pathogen testing results into distribution modeling. They further note that recent calls for increased monitoring of understudied Dermacentor species highlight the need for expanding pathogen testing capabilities to other existing networks. Lastly, they suggest that targeted surveillance to resolve distributional boundaries for tick-borne pathogens will benefit future efforts to further refine geographic risk estimates.\n\nNo additional limitations were explicitly mentioned in the text.",

The authors also highlighted the limitations of current tick distribution maps as proxies for transmission risk maps and suggested incorporating pathogen testing results into distribution modeling to help constrain areas of transmission risk exposure.\n\nNo limitations are explicitly provided by the authors. However, it's worth noting that the study had some limitations, such as the reliance on passive surveillance data which may not capture the full picture of tick distribution and transmission risk, and the focus on RF models as the sole method for SDM. Additional limitations may include the potential for model overfitting or undersampling, the impact of environmental variability and temporal dynamics on tick distribution and transmission risk, and the potential for spatial and temporal autocorrelation in tick occurrence data. It would be important for future studies to address these limitations and consider a combination of methods for SDM, such as machine learning algorithms and statistical models, to improve model accuracy and reliability.",
