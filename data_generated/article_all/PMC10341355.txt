The most important finding of this study is that common vitreomacular interface (VMI) abnormalities, including epiretinal membrane (ERM), posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), vitreomacular adhesion (VMA), and macular hole (MH), have heritable components and understanding their genetics could potentially lead to new treatments. The authors acknowledge some limitations, including the underpowering to calculate heritability for certain VMI subtypes, the lack of consensus on ERM grading, and the different OCT devices and imaging protocols impacting detection and diagnosis. No clear statement is made regarding sex differences or environmental risk factors. The study's cohort is predominantly White Caucasian women, potentially limiting generalizability to other populations.
