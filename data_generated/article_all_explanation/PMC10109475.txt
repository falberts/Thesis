The most important finding of the study is that population structure heterogeneity, varying compliance with NPIs, and waning vaccine efficacy contribute to recurrent COVID-19 epidemic waves. The authors used a pandemic response modeling approach in Australia during the fourth pandemic stage and found that social distancing adoption is a critical factor affecting the incidence dynamics. They emphasized the need for timely communication campaigns and agile booster vaccination campaigns. The study also suggested that infections during the last wave were mostly driven by reinfections or low/waning vaccine effectiveness.

Limitations of the study include the use of outdated population data, lack of modeling for transmissions in healthcare facilities, and not considering the explicit decline in vaccine efficacy in their model. The authors acknowledge that their results could benefit from further analysis of the latest Omicron sub-variants. They also note that their model may be used to contribute to future agile, adaptive, and multi-faceted public health responses.
