The study found that the fraction of individuals adopting social distancing requirements fluctuated in response to pandemic dynamics, impacting incidence trajectories, and emphasized the need for agile communication campaigns to address potential fatigue and complacency. The authors also acknowledged several limitations, including the use of outdated census data for population generation, absence of simulating transmissions within healthcare facilities, and the assumption that vaccine efficacy declines are offset by booster doses. They acknowledge that the results may benefit from further analysis of the latest Omicron sub-variants.
