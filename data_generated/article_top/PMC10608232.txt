The most important finding of the study is that children with asthmatic bronchitis and asthma exhibit distinct immune dysregulation, with higher levels of B cells and CD4/CD8 cells in asthmatic bronchitis and lower levels of CD8+ T cells and NK cells in both diseases. The study also found lower levels of IgG, IgA, tIgE, and C3 in serum. Two machine learning models, RF and ET, were established to distinguish between the two types of diseases, with RF performing better. The research has limitations, including the relatively small dataset and lack of supplementary data. The authors plan to expand the dataset and incorporate multi-center studies in future research to enhance the model's accuracy. No other limitations were explicitly mentioned in the text.
