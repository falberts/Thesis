The study updates RF models of D. variabilis and D. variabilis infected with R. montanensis using additional surveillance and testing data, finding that the inclusion of novel data slightly altered suitability predictions but showed greater infection risk in the southeastern United States. The authors note several limitations, including the challenges of directly comparing tick occurrence data from different sources due to potential differences in sampling effort and methods, the possibility that climate variables may not capture all aspects of the niche for these vectors, and the importance of considering other factors, such as host availability and demography, to accurately model tick distributions and infection risks. Additionally, they acknowledge that their analysis focused on specific tick-borne pathogens but that understanding the relationship between tick distributions, the distribution of other tick-borne pathogens, and climate could provide valuable insights into disease risk dynamics. They also emphasize the need for continued monitoring and validation of tick distribution models through targeted surveillance and field studies. No limitations are provided by the authors regarding the methods or assumptions of their modeling approach.
