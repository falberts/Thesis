        "summ": "The study found that 68% of participants performed better in a Working Memory task with white noise (WN) compared to no noise, while 24% showed no difference, and 8% performed worst with noise. The authors suggest that Stochastic Resonance (SR) may explain this phenomenon by reducing neural activity and freeing up cognitive resources for higher WM task performance. However, the effects of WN on WM remain unclear, and more studies are needed to understand the constructive role of noise. The study also revealed a high prevalence of mild cognitive impairment and low WM capacity, as well as anxiety and depression symptoms in chronic tinnitus patients. However, the small sample size and lack of a control group limit the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the relationship between higher tinnitus handicap scores and worse WM performance was not statistically significant, and more research is needed to understand the effect of WN on high WM tests among participants with chronic tinnitus and normal hearing.\n\nNo explicit limitations are provided by the authors. However, possible limitations could be the small sample size and the lack of a control group that could have helped better understand the influence of white noise and avoid any bias. Additionally, the influence of personal motivation during test performance was not taken into account. Further research is needed to support the findings, especially in the areas of WM and Stochastic Resonance.",

The authors suggest that Stochastic Resonance (SR) may explain this phenomenon, but they also acknowledge that this hypothesis may be insufficient from an acoustical point of view. They further suggest that SR may regulate neural activity by reducing neural activity and suppressing tinnitus awareness, freeing up cognitive resources for high working memory task performance.\n\nThe authors explicitly acknowledge some limitations of their study. They mention the limited consensus in the literature on the effects of white noise on working memory and suggest that the variety of approaches used for these measurements may contribute to the lack of consensus. They also acknowledge the need for more research to fully understand the effects of white noise on working memory and to determine the optimal S/N ratio for maximizing these benefits. Another limitation they mention is the impact of individual differences, such as age, cognition, and years of education, on the results of the study. They suggest that future studies should control for these factors to minimize potential sources of confounding. They also note that the sample size in their study may have been too small to reach statistically significant conclusions, and that larger studies may be necessary to confirm their findings. Lastly, they mention the lack of a control group in their study, which may have limited their ability to definitively attribute the observed effects to the presence of white noise, as other factors may have influenced the results.",
