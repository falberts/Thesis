The study suggests that laparoscopic MAL release with stenting during the same procedure is a safe and feasible technique for patients with Dunbar syndrome, resulting in lower operative times and postoperative complications compared to open access surgery in experienced hands. No clear evidence exists on the need for endovascular revascularization after MAL release, and the timing remains uncertain. The authors acknowledge some limitations, including the retrospective design, the small sample size, and the lack of a standardized approach for post-operative management of TC or SMA stenosis after MAL release. The authors also note that only a few studies have reported series of more than 10 cases for comparison, and more research is needed to establish the optimal management strategy. They recommend systematic investigations for every patient found to have an MAL, and consideration of a laparoscopic release and stenting for symptomatic Dunbar syndrome patients.
