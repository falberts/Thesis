The most important finding of the study is that the inclusion of novel surveillance data in a previous RF model resulted in negligible differences in distribution estimates for Dermacentor variantabilis and its infection by Rickettsia montanensis, but highlighted the need for increased surveillance and targeted pathogen testing in areas of disagreement.

The authors acknowledge several limitations in the study. They note that while the updated models showed similar patterns of variable importance, there may be a need to consider the roles of different components of climate on shaping the niches for these vectors. They also mention that the predicted suitability distribution of the infected niche is geographically constrained compared to the full predicted suitability distribution, with most disagreement along the southern and western peripheries. The authors suggest that the limitations of using vector distribution maps as proxies for transmission risk maps directly can be addressed by incorporating pathogen testing results into distribution modeling. They further note that recent calls for increased monitoring of understudied Dermacentor species highlight the need for expanding pathogen testing capabilities to other existing networks. Lastly, they suggest that targeted surveillance to resolve distributional boundaries for tick-borne pathogens will benefit future efforts to further refine geographic risk estimates.
