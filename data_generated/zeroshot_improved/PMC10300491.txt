The most important finding of this study is that there is evidence of positive associations between occupational exposure as a firefighter and cancer incidence for several sites, including bladder, testis, prostate, thyroid, and colon cancer, as well as mesothelioma, NHL, and melanoma.

No explicit limitations are provided by the authors in this text, but they do acknowledge the influence of bias and the plausibility of exposures in the occupation as considerations for causal assessments. They also mention the challenges of conducting causal assessments due to the large volume of research on this topic, which includes significant changes in the types of activities performed, use of personal protective equipment, and composition of exposures over time and by region and type of fire suppression activity. They also mention the influence of medical surveillance bias, healthy worker hire and survivor bias, and confounding. Additionally, they note that the findings for mesothelioma have only recently become observable with adequate validity due to the lack of a cause-of-death code before 1999, which may have obscured the risk of this cancer in older cohort studies. They also mention the potential impact of smoking and tobacco exposure on their findings but do not control for it directly in any of the analyses.
