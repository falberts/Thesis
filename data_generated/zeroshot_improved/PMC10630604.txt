The most important finding of this study is that 68% of the seventeen participants showed better performance in the WN condition for working memory tests, while 24% showed the same performance, and 8% performed worse. The authors suggest that Stochastic Resonance (SR) may explain this phenomenon, but they also acknowledge that this hypothesis may be insufficient from an acoustical point of view. They further suggest that SR may regulate neural activity by reducing neural activity and suppressing tinnitus awareness, freeing up cognitive resources for high working memory task performance.

The authors explicitly acknowledge some limitations of their study. They mention the limited consensus in the literature on the effects of white noise on working memory and suggest that the variety of approaches used for these measurements may contribute to the lack of consensus. They also acknowledge the need for more research to fully understand the effects of white noise on working memory and to determine the optimal S/N ratio for maximizing these benefits. Another limitation they mention is the impact of individual differences, such as age, cognition, and years of education, on the results of the study. They suggest that future studies should control for these factors to minimize potential sources of confounding. They also note that the sample size in their study may have been too small to reach statistically significant conclusions, and that larger studies may be necessary to confirm their findings. Lastly, they mention the lack of a control group in their study, which may have limited their ability to definitively attribute the observed effects to the presence of white noise, as other factors may have influenced the results.
