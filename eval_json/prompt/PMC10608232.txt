[START TEXT]Asthmatic bronchitis and asthma are heterogeneous diseases that require individualized and specific treatment. Studying the mechanism of disease can provide effective information for clinical doctors to improve treatment. The change in lymphocyte subsets, immunoglobulin and complement levels in peripheral blood can reflect the status of the immune function of the body under different conditions. In peripheral blood, it was found that B cells and CD4/CD8 were higher in the asthmatic bronchitis group than that in the asthma children, while levels of CD8+ T cells, and NK cells were lower. Furthermore, IgG, IgA, tIgE, and C3 levels in serum were lower than those in the asthma group. These results indicate that children with asthmatic bronchitis and asthma exhibit distinct degrees of immune dysregulation, characterized by divergent patterns of humoral and cellular immune responses.
Based on significance testing of difference, we also have performed an importance ranking of immunological biomarkers, and CD8+ T cells and B cells have shown high rankings in this assessment. CD8+ T lymphocytes belong to suppressor/killer T lymphocytes, and their main function is to kill target cells directly. Compared to CD4+ T cells, there has been less research on CD8+ T cells in children with asthma. Both CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells can mediate hypersensitivity, but CD4+ (class II MHC molecules) and CD8+ T cells (class I MHC molecules) pertain to the recognition of antigens presented by different MHC molecules. Some scholars have pointed out that compared to CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells have a stronger association with the severity of asthma. CD8+ T cells that produce high levels of IFN-gamma (TC1 cells) have been shown to be associated with an attenuation of pulmonary allergic inflammation in rodent models. In addition, levels of mononuclear cells, CD8+ T cells, and macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of asthma patients are significantly elevated. B cells can differentiate into plasma cells under antigen stimulation, then synthesize, store, and secrete antibodies (immunoglobulins) to participate in humoral immunity responses. B cells also have been recognized as important mediators in allergy and tolerance. IgE secreted by B cells is a central player in childhood allergic reactions and one of the causes of wheezing. The binding of IgE to its receptor on the surface of mast cells activates IgE-sensitized antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and Th2 cells, thereby promoting the production of IgE by B cells to supplement the IgE consumed in allergic reactions, and maintaining mast cells and APCs sensitization, causing bronchospasm or wheezing. These studies suggest that both CD8+ T cells and B cells play important roles in the development and progression of both asthmatic bronchitis and asthma, which were consistent with our results.
Significance testing of difference is a type of hypothesis testing used to detect differences between experimental and control groups and determine their significance. Although the purpose is to discover more valuable information, it cannot achieve disease classification and assist in diagnosis. ML can improve the accuracy and predictive ability of models by utilizing large amounts of data and fast-computing power, thereby helping doctors diagnose diseases and develop personalized treatment plans more accurately.
We established 7 ML models by using selected immunological biomarkers to distinguish between two types of diseases to help rapid diagnosis. However, different ML models have their own advantages and disadvantages, leading to varying results in model testing. Compared to other models, RF and ET performed better, with consistent accuracy in K-fold cross-validation and ML testing. RF and ET are similar in structure consisting of numerous decision trees, but they differ in the training set for each decision tree. RF uses the Bagging model (Bootstrap Aggregating) to randomly extract training samples for the training set, while ET uses all training samples. After selecting the partition feature, the decision tree of RF will choose an optimal feature value partition point based on principles such as entropy, Gini index, and standard deviation, which is the same as traditional decision trees. However, ET is more aggressive and randomly selects a feature value to partition the decision tree. Because the partition point of the feature value is randomly selected instead of the optimal point, this will generally result in a larger decision tree size than the decision tree generated by RF. In other words, the variance of ET is further reduced relative to RF, but the bias is further increased. Considering the higher Brier score of ET in comparison to the RF model, the RF model was ultimately selected as the preferred choice.
Looking ahead, we envisage the integration of our model into telemedicine platforms, allowing for the remote monitoring and assessment of patients, thereby broadening the reach of healthcare services, especially in regions with limited access to healthcare facilities. This model could also foster advancements in research, aiding in the deeper exploration of the underlying mechanisms of these diseases, and potentially spearheading the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Moreover, it could serve as an educational tool, assisting in the training of healthcare professionals to recognize and comprehend the complex immunological patterns associated with these conditions. In the broader context, the insights garnered from the utilization of this model could influence policy and healthcare planning, shaping strategies aimed at alleviating the burden these diseases impose on the healthcare system.
However, our research also has several limitations that need to be addressed. The ML dataset was relatively small and lacked supplementary data such as radiological images, which might introduce bias into the results. Despite these current limitations, we plan to augment our dataset with a larger patient pool and incorporate multi-center studies to enhance the model’s accuracy in the future. This expansion would potentially allow for a more comprehensive diagnostic platform that integrates various diagnostic tools, offering a holistic view of the patient’s health status and fostering a more nuanced understanding of these diseases.

For factual consistency, a score of 1 is assigned when all information is in line with the original text. A score of 2 is assigned, for example when the information is correct but contains little to no detail. A score of 3 is assigned when the summary contains information that is not in line with the original text.
        
For coverage, a score of 1 is assigned when the summary covers all limitations mentioned in the original text. A score of 2 is assigned when all limitations are mentioned, but not explained. A score of 3 is assigned when the summary fails to mention all limitations.
        
For coherence, a score of 1 is assigned when the summary is coherent and does not contain hallucinations. A score of 2 is assigned when the summary does not follow the instructions in the prompt perfectly, but is still coherent and does not include hallucinations. A score of 3 is assigned when the summary contains hallucinations or is incomprehensible, for example when abbreviations are used but never explained.
