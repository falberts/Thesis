The most important finding in this study is that there is evidence of positive associations between occupational exposure as a firefighter and cancer incidence for multiple sites, including bladder, testis, prostate, thyroid, and colon cancer, as well as mesothelioma, NHL, and melanoma, but the complex mixtures of carcinogenic hazards, exposure variation, and bias make causal assessments challenging.

The authors acknowledge several limitations, including substantial bias due to medical surveillance, healthy worker hire and survivor bias, confounding, and the presence of various carcinogenic hazards with complex mixtures and changing exposures over time and differences by region and type of fire suppression activity. Additionally, they note the lack of information on tobacco smoking prevalence and control in studies, which could obscure or confound the observed associations.
