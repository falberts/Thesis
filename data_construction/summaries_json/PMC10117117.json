        "summ": "The study analyzed the metatranscriptome of the colorectal cancer (CRC) gut microbiota, revealing its functional dependency on the host's health state, mechanisms of microbial modulation by and modulation of the malignant gut state, and adaptations to environmental pressures, providing insights into gut microbiome's protective role against cancer and its adaptive responses to the tumor environment.\n\nThe authors do acknowledge some limitations in the study. Firstly, they highlight the need to identify the specific environmental signals regulating microbial antioxidative activities, such as diet, antibiotics, toxins, or other pressures. Secondly, they emphasize the importance of characterizing the pressures promoting the enhanced antibiotic resistance phenotype observed during CRC, especially concerning postoperative infection prevention in patients undergoing surgery. Finally, the authors underscore the significance of understanding and manipulating the adaptive mechanisms that the gut microbiota employs for nutrient competition, genetic material exchange, and control of other gut species' prevalence and activity, particularly in the context of developing bacteria-based therapy.",
