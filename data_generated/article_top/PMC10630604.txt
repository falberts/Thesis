The most important finding in this study is that white noise (WN) improved working memory (WM) performance in some participants with tinnitus, possibly through the Stochastic Resonance (SR) phenomenon or by reducing neural activity and suppressing tinnitus awareness. However, the effects of WN on WM are not yet fully understood, and there is no consensus in the literature about the role of noise in WM tasks. The sample in this study had great variability in age, cognition, and education levels, and the study could have benefited from a control group for a better comparison. The authors also acknowledged the potential influence of personal motivation on test performance. (limitations: sample variability, small sample size, lack of control group, absence of assessment of personal motivation)
