The largest meta-analysis and meta-regression on postpartum depression (PPD) prevalence found that the unadjusted global prevalence rate using the EPDS scale is 19.18%, while the adjusted prevalence of possible and probable PPD is 19.9% and 18.28%, respectively. The most significant predictor of cross-national variation in PPD was SSB consumption. The authors acknowledge some limitations, including the potential for overestimation of PPD due to the use of self-report measures, challenges in collecting accurate nutrition data, and the ecological fallacy of analyzing aggregate data. The study did not find a statistically significant association between seafood consumption and PPD, contradicting a previous report, and also did not find relationships between fiber, yogurt, fruit, and vegetable consumption and national PPD prevalence. The authors encourage researchers to continue studying the relationship between these dietary factors and PPD, and suggest that policies reducing SSB consumption and high fructose corn syrup use may help prevent PPD. The text does not mention any other limitations.
