The most important finding in this study is that observed climate trends can be used to predict future distributions of Ae. albopictus and associated dengue risks in China, which may expand to nearly all populated areas and extend the risk season from June-September to April-October by 2050. However, the authors acknowledge several limitations, including the lack of surveillance data in certain areas, the potential bias of climate predictions in sparsely monitored regions, the uncertainty of future climate change trends, and the unknown distribution and impact of other mosquito species, particularly those that could transmit diseases at high altitudes.
