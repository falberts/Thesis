        "summ": "The study found that white noise improved working memory performance in a majority of participants with chronic tinnitus, suggesting a potential role for stochastic resonance, but acknowledged limitations including sample variability and lack of a control group.\n\nThe authors explicitly acknowledge limitations in their study. They mention the variability in the sample regarding age, cognition, and years of education, highlighting the potential for confounding factors. Additionally, they note the absence of a control group, which could have provided clearer insights into the influence of white noise. The authors recognize the need for precise matching of such a control group with respect to age, cognitive level, and education to avoid bias. Moreover, they hint at the possible influence of personal motivation during test performance as another limitation. These acknowledgments demonstrate an awareness of the study's constraints, including sample heterogeneity and methodological considerations, which could impact the generalizability and interpretation of the findings.",

The limitations include:\n\n* Great variability in the sample with regards to age, cognition and years of education.\n* Lack of a control group which could have helped understand the influence of white noise better. However, creating a control group that exactly matches the tinnitus group in terms of age, cognitive level and education would be challenging.\n* Possible influence of personal motivation on the test performance which the study design cannot account for.",

They note that their sample showed great variability in terms of age, cognition, and years of education, which could have influenced the results. They also mention the absence of a control group, which could have provided a better understanding of the influence of white noise. However, they point out that such a group would need to be exactly matched with age, cognitive level, and education to avoid any bias. Lastly, they highlight the potential influence of personal motivation during the test performance, which could not be controlled for in their study.
