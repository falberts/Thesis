The most important finding in this study is that VLPs derived from the major capsid protein VP1 of nine HPyVs are immunogenic and can induce strong humoral and cellular immune responses. The authors demonstrate the uptake of these VLPs by primary mouse macrophages and show that they act as a delivery platform and an adjuvant at the same time. However, they emphasize the importance of regular VLP assembly to ensure native-like particles with optimal antigenic properties.

The authors do not explicitly mention any limitations in the given text. However, there are a few potential areas that could be considered for future research. For example, the study focuses primarily on mouse models for investigating the uptake and immune response to HPyV VLPs. Further studies using human cell lines or primary human immune cells would provide a more accurate representation of the human immune response to these VLPs. Additionally, the study focuses on the immunogenicity of VP1 VLPs and does not explore the potential impact of other viral proteins or the genetic diversity of HPyVs on immune response or disease outcomes. Further investigation in this area could shed light on potential new targets for vaccine development or therapies for PyV-associated diseases.
